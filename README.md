# NoPainNoGain

game turned out really badly. the code and sprites were there, but it was really hard for me to actually implement it. 
i hope the codework will suffice.


No Pain, No Gain (Game Concept)

No Pain, No Gain is a turn based fighting game where two players fight to the death, investing money and spending money on stronger attacks. First player to die loses.

The prototype was originally gonna have 4 characters, but because of time, i only made two.

Pirate is well rounded character with a balanced kit, consisting one attack skill, one defense skill, and one economy skill.
    Flintlock Blast: Deals true damage, ignoring enemy defense
    Cutlass Parry: Parries an attack this turn, but cannot be used on the next turn.
    Dabble Doubloons: Buries money and returns at a greater value later.

ATM is a non-playable character that focuses on charging up one attack, Task: Kill
    while(true): A passive that allows ATM to accrue cash every turn.
    ecrypt: A defensive skills that makes ATM immune to losing cash for a turn.
    PHASE_TWO:COLLATERAL_MODE: An unlockable passive that taxes the opponent when they spend money. 10% of the money spent will be sent to ATM's budget.
    TASK:KILL: ATM's only attack. It costs high amounts of money, but when activated, it will instantly kill the opponent.


The game was also supposed to have random events such as raises and inflation, but it wasnt implemented
